# Venge Bugs

This repository is a structured, community driven documentation project focused on identifying, categorizing and tracking bugs present in [Venge.io](https://venge.io/). The main purpose is to create a clear and organized reference that supports the understanding, reproduction and long term monitoring of in-game technical issues.

By collecting reports from players and presenting them in a consistent format, this project aims to provide a reliable knowledge base that may assist in recognizing recurring problems, observing patterns across updates and improving overall game stability.

The repository functions as an open and continuously evolving archive of known issues, maintained through community contribution and careful documentation.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, feel free to reach out on Discord: [kanzyone](https://discord.com/users/1238205250461106230).

# Checklist
The full checklist of documented bugs is available in the file [github.com/Kanzyone/Venge-Bugs/blob/main/Checklist.md](https://github.com/Kanzyone/Venge-Bugs/blob/main/Checklist.md)

It provides a structured overview of known issues across different areas of the game, including their status and relative priority.

# Issues
This repository is the main fork that contains the bug documentation, structure and <code><a href="https://github.com/users/Kanzyone/projects/5">project board</a></code> used to track progress.
Due to GitHub limitations with forks, new Issues cannot be created directly here.

To keep bug tracking active and organized, a separate repository named <code><a href="https://github.com/Kanzyone/issues-vengebugs">issues-vengebugs</a></code> is used to create and manage all Issues. After an Issue is opened there, it is manually linked and added to this repository’s Project Board for centralized planning and tracking.

This workflow allows this repository to remain the main hub for organization, status tracking and development overview, while all bug reports are collected in a dedicated space.

The Wiki is intended to help readers better understand how issues are identified, categorized, and documented over time. It also explains how bug reports are created, what information is required and how findings from testers and Discord feedback are organized.

If you are looking for detailed explanations, reporting guidelines, or an overview of known issues, please [visit the Wiki](https://github.com/Kanzyone/Venge-Bugs/wiki/Wiki).
