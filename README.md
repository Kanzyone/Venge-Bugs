# Venge Bugs

This repository is a structured, community driven documentation project focused on identifying, categorizing and tracking bugs present in [Venge.io](https://venge.io/). The main purpose is to create a clear and organized reference that supports the understanding, reproduction and long term monitoring of in-game technical issues.

By collecting reports from players and presenting them in a consistent format, this project aims to provide a reliable knowledge base that may assist in recognizing recurring problems, observing patterns across updates and improving overall game stability.

The repository functions as an open and continuously evolving archive of known issues, maintained through community contribution and careful documentation.

_This is an unofficial project and is not directly affiliated with the Venge.io development team. All content is based on player observations and reports._

If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback, feel free to reach out on Discord: [kanzyone](https://discord.com/users/1238205250461106230).
