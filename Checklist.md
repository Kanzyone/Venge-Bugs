# Bug Checklist

This section contains a structured checklist of known and reported issues observed across different areas of Venge.io. The purpose of this list is to provide a clear and organized overview of recurring technical problems, grouped by system and gameplay components.

Each entry represents a documented issue identified through in-game observation and community reporting. Bugs are categorized by area (such as <b>Main UI</b>, <b>In-Game systems</b>, <b>Heroes</b>, <b>Weapons</b>, <b>Maps</b>, <b>Social Hub</b>, and <b>Map Editor</b>) and marked with indicators that reflect their current status and relative priority.

This checklist is intended to function as a continuously evolving reference. It allows readers to quickly understand which issues are currently active, which have been resolved, and which may require further verification. By presenting this information in a consistent format, the list supports easier tracking, comparison and long term documentation of technical problems across updates.

The goal is not only to record individual bugs, but to maintain a structured archive that reflects the overall technical state of the game environment over time.
